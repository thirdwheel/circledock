# CircleDock
A fork of CircleDock from https://circledock.sf.net/ - code is as it was when it was licensed under GPLv3 under VideoInPicture's care.

## Goals
* x86-64 and ARM64 builds
* Fixing performance and stability issues
* Fixing mouse button capture - seems to no longer work under Windows 10
* Code refactor to aid in developer uptake

If you think you can help with these, fork, fix, and send a pull request.
